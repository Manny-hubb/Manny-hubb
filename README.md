## 🚀 About Me

I'm a recent graduate with a growing passion for all areas of cybersecurity — from offensive (Red Team) tactics to defensive (Blue Team) operations and everything in between. I'm building hands-on experience through:

- Real-world simulations in my home lab  
- Platforms like TryHackMe & Hack The Box  
- Continuous self-learning in threat detection, vulnerability exploitation, and incident response  

My mission is to understand how systems break — and how to secure them better.

## 💻 Current Focus Areas

- 🔍 **Penetration Testing & Exploitation** – Recon, enumeration, privilege escalation, web app attacks  
- 🛡️ **SOC & Blue Team Tools** – Log analysis, SIEM, IDS/IPS, digital forensics  
- 🧠 **Purple Teaming** – Using attacker mindset to strengthen defenses  
- 🧪 **Lab Projects** – Custom-built attack/defend simulations in VirtualBox
